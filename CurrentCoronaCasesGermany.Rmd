## About this blog post

UPDATE: I have stopped automatically updating the graphs in March 2023, as the testing obligations in Germany have changed drastically around this time and cases were less riliably reported.

This post provides some basic visualizations of recent Covid-19 data (cumulative cases and day-to day changes in these number by state) from Germany. I am well aware of the fact that there are plenty of such visualizations all across the internet. Since I am quite new to blogging, my main motivation for writing this post was teaching myself how to include data from other repositories in **R-Markdown** documents for static and interactive visualizations using **ggplot** and **Plotly**. The topic was secondary, but still I will try to keep this blog up to date for those of you who came here for the Covid-19 data. A link to the .rmd file can be found at the bottom of this page for those of you interested in the R code, instead.

On mobile devices, use landscape mode for the interactive graphs to be displayed correctly.

Please note that there is an obvious error (as of February, the 14th, 2021) in the estimation of recovered cases in the original data from Johns Hopkins University for the 27th of January 2021. I "smoothed" the plot at this point by interpolating the number of recovered cases between the reported numbers from January 26th and January 28th, 2021. Non-cumulative, active cases were calculated as the difference between the cumulative active and the cumulative recovered and deceased curves. Also, in August 2021 Johns Hopkins University stopped listing the number of recovered cases for Germany, i.e. recovered and active cases are no longer depicted (from the 4th of August, 2021, onward).

## R-Markdown

The graph presented in this blog was created with up-to-date data at the time of page rendering using R-Markdown. If you would like to know how, you will find the .rmd file [here](https://github.com/DaSchmidtke/CovidGermany/).
